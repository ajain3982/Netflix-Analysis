## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Netflix Movie/TV Shows data to understand:

1. What are the countries which produce most content on netflix.
2. What the top categories of movies produced ?
3. What is the growth of the content over the years ?
4. Is there a way we can recommend movies using product description ?
